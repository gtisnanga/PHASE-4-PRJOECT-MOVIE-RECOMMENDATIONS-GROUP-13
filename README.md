# Executive Summary
This project aims to improve Netflix’s recommendation system to solve the issue of users endlessly scrolling to find content they enjoy. By enhancing the recommendation engine, Netflix seeks to provide more personalized and relevant suggestions, increasing user engagement and viewing time, while reducing decision fatigue.


# DATA DESCRIPTION
There are a number of csv files available with different columns in the Data file. 

movies.csv

ratings.csv

tags.csv

links.csv

# Modelling
The reccommendation system employs both collaborative filtering and content based filtering methods. It uses matrix factorization techniques for collaborative filtering and cosine similarity for content based filtering.

# Evaluation
The system is evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error for rating predictions accuracy.

# Deployment
Deployment was done by Gradio.

# Future work
Real-Time Recommendation Capabilities: Develop a real-time recommendation system that leverages live user activity and streaming data. 

Advanced Modeling Techniques: Investigate the potential of using more sophisticated algorithms, such as neural network-based matrix factorization or reinforcement learning approaches, to further enhance the accuracy and personalization of recommendations.

Enhanced User Profiles: Strengthen user profiles by integrating additional data sources, such as explicit preferences and social media activity. T

Cross-Platform Consistency: Expand the system’s functionality to ensure consistent performance and a seamless user experience across different devices, including mobile apps and web interfaces.

A/B Testing and Continuous Optimization: Implement A/B testing to assess different recommendation strategies and optimize the system based on real-world performance data.
